[h2]Introduction[/h2]
Has this ever happened to you? Training Center is highlighted, indicating that an opportunity to upgrade a bond is available. You click the bond staffing slot, read the list of bond pairs available for training, and... you don't recognize the bondmates off their Firstname Lastname. So you go to Barracks to refresh your memory, find the nicknames and are then able to make the decision instantly.

By now you should've guessed that this mod [b]adds nicknames to the bond training dropdown list[/b]. It also works for all other soldier staffing slots, like GTS rookie training, Psi training, and Infirmary trait removal.

[h2]Compatibility[/h2]
Found compatible with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2098062078][WotC] No Drop Down Lists With Controller Support[/url] and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2752150336][WOTC] No Drop Down Lists: Remove Traits[/url]. The more detailed lists provided by those two take precedence, and this mod provides a fallback method to the lists they leave unmodified.

[h2]Acknowledgements[/h2]
Thanks to DerAva for making me realize I also wanted this UI behaviour.
